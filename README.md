## The Database service for this project is no longer being hosted, as such the project is currently in a completed but non-operational state.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project was created as a submission for the CSC 478 Senior Project at UIS.

This Journaling Webapp project is a CRUD app hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) and can be run locally using `pnpm run dev` (assuming environment variables for a development database and Clerk connection are provided).
